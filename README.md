# clickfaitAPI
API server for clickfait. This uses a BERT model to classify sentences or phrases as clickbait or not.

I originally used an LSTM (see playground) as I was just starting to learn about NLP and deep learning models when I learned about BERT and made the switch.

The API server is meant to be called by clickfait, the website I made to store users' evaluations, but I scrapped that part of the project.
